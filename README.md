🚀 Automating Financial Data Analysis with AI 📊🤖
I'm excited to share a project I've been working on that leverages the power of LangChain, Groq's Gemma 2 LLM, and Python to automate data analysis using natural language.
🔍 What I built:
An intelligent agent that takes in a CSV file with financial data and allows users to ask any question about it—no coding or Excel formulas required. From summaries to trend analysis, the agent responds in real time using conversational AI.
🧠 How it works:
•	Powered by LangChain's CSV agent
•	Connected to Gemma 2 LLM via Groq API
•	Performs real-time data analysis and reasoning over tabular data
•	All operations controlled via natural language prompts
💡 Use case:
A step toward automating the data analysis workflow—making financial insights more accessible to non-technical users.
